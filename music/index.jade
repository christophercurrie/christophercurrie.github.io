  p.
    From 2005 to 2009 I sang with an a cappella group of four to five people, all employees of Amazon.com. We sang
    mostly covers pulled from our various college groups libraries, adapted for the parts we had on hand; initial four
    men, then adding a soprano, then swapping in two new men when the soprano and original baritone left the company.

  p.
    We just missed the ubiquity of smartphones before we broke up; as far as I know, no video of our performances survive.
