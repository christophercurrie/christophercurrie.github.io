# Dickens Carolers

In 2013 I sang with the [Dickens Carolers][] for the first time. A polished,
professional organization, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and hope to
return in the future.

# Missing Pages

From 2005 to 2009 I sang with an _a capella_ group of four to five people, all
employees of Amazon.com. We sang mostly covers pulled from our various college
groups libraries, adapted for the parts we had on hand; initially four men,
then adding a soprano, then swapping in two new men when the soprano and
original baritone left the company.

We just missed the ubiquity of smartphones before we broke up; as far as I know,
no video of our performances survive.
