<div><h1>Dickens Carolers</h1><p>In 2013 I sang with the&#32;<a href="http://www.dickenscarolers.com">Dickens Carolers</a> for the first time. A polished, professional organization, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and hope to
return in the future.</p></div><div><h1>Missing Pages</h1><p>From 2005 to 2009 I sang with an a cappella group of four to five people, all employees of Amazon.com. We sang
mostly covers pulled from our various college groups libraries, adapted for the parts we had on hand; initial four
men, then adding a soprano, then swapping in two new men when the soprano and original baritone left the company.
</p><p>We just missed the ubiquity of smartphones before we broke up; as far as I know, no video of our performances survive.
